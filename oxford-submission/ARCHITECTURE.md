# 🏗️ System Architecture & Development Process

## Overview

This document provides a technical breakdown of the Multi-Agent Loan Processing System, including the prompt engineering process used to build this low-code solution.

## Development Philosophy: Low-Code + AI Orchestration

This system demonstrates **prompt-driven development** - using natural language instructions to orchestrate AI workflows without traditional coding. Each component was built through strategic prompting and integration.

## Complete Prompt Engineering Process

### Phase 1: Frontend Development (Lovable)

**Initial Application Creation Prompt:**
```
Create a comprehensive loan application form with the following requirements:
- Professional styling with jade/green branding
- 13 essential fields including personal information, financial data, and loan details
- Form validation and professional UI
- Webhook integration for form submission
- Responsive design suitable for all devices

The form should feel professional and trustworthy for financial applications.
```

**Form Enhancement Prompts:**
```
Add comprehensive financial assessment fields while maintaining branding:
- Credit score field
- Debt-to-income ratio
- Employment history
- Asset declarations
- Loan purpose specification
- Professional validation patterns
```

### Phase 2: AI Agent Development (Lyzr)

**Risk Intelligence Agent Prompt:**
```
Agent Role: Risk Intelligence Agent specialized in loan application analysis.
Agent Goal: Analyze applications to identify risk factors and assess creditworthiness.
Agent Instructions:
- EXAMINE all financial data points
- CALCULATE key financial ratios
- ASSESS risk factors based on credit, employment, and capacity
- PROVIDE confidence score (1-100)
- FORMAT response in clear HTML sections

Deliver professional, data-driven analysis suitable for financial stakeholders.
```

**Decision Explainer Agent Prompt:**
```
Agent Role: Decision Explainer Agent focused on translating analysis into recommendations.
Agent Goal: Transform risk analysis into clear explanations and actionable next steps.
Agent Instructions:
- INTERPRET risk analysis results
- EXPLAIN reasoning in plain language
- PROVIDE specific next steps
- FORMAT in structured HTML sections

Ensure explanations are professional yet accessible to stakeholders.
```

### Phase 3: Workflow Orchestration (Make.com)

**Workflow Design Strategy:**

**Module 1: Webhook Receiver**
- Purpose: Capture form submissions from Lovable
- Configuration: JSON payload processing

**Module 2: Risk Intelligence Agent**
- Purpose: Primary risk analysis
- Integration: Lyzr API call with form data

**Module 3: Decision Explainer Agent**
- Purpose: Decision reasoning and next steps
- Integration: Secondary Lyzr API call

**Module 4: Text Parser**
- Purpose: Extract structured sections from HTML
- Configuration: Regex patterns for content extraction

**Module 5: Gmail Integration**
- Purpose: Send professional stakeholder communication

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing

**System Testing Approach:**
- Form Submission Testing: Verified 13-field data capture
- Agent Response Testing: Confirmed HTML output format
- Parser Validation: Tested regex extraction patterns
- Email Delivery Testing: Verified stakeholder notification
- End-to-End Testing: Complete pipeline validation

## Data Flow Architecture

**Request Flow:**
User Input → Lovable Form → Make.com Webhook → Lyzr Risk Agent → Lyzr Decision Agent → Text Parser → Gmail → Stakeholder

**Data Transformations:**
- Form Data: 13 fields → JSON payload
- Risk Analysis: JSON → HTML formatted assessment
- Decision Analysis: JSON → HTML formatted recommendations
- Text Extraction: HTML → Structured sections
- Email Composition: Sections → Professional communication

## Technical Implementation Details

**Frontend (Lovable/React)**
- Technology: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- Architecture: Component-based with form validation
- Integration: RESTful webhook submission

**AI Agents (Lyzr)**
- Risk Intelligence Agent ID: 6863ee3906bcd0ccc1a73458
- Decision Explainer Agent ID: 68640158c781c1fdd3a67701
- Output Format: Structured HTML sections
- Processing: Sequential agent orchestration

**Workflow Engine (Make.com)**
- Architecture: 5-module pipeline
- Trigger: Webhook receiver
- Processing: Dual agent calls + text parsing
- Output: Gmail stakeholder notification

**Communication (Gmail API)**
- Integration: Make.com Gmail module
- Format: Professional email template
- Content: Parsed agent analysis

## System Performance

**Current Metrics:**
- Response Time: < 30 seconds end-to-end
- Success Rate: 100% in testing
- Agent Accuracy: Consistent structured output
- Email Delivery: Confirmed stakeholder receipt

**Scalability Considerations:**
- Make.com: Operations per month limits
- Lyzr Agents: API rate limits
- Gmail Integration: Daily send limits
- Frontend Hosting: Lovable platform capacity

## Security & Configuration

**API Keys Required:**
- OpenAI API: For Lyzr agent processing
- Make.com: Workflow orchestration
- Gmail API: Email integration
- Lovable: Frontend hosting

**Data Handling:**
- Form Data: Transmitted via secure webhook
- Processing: Temporary storage in Make.com
- Output: Email delivery, no persistent storage
- Privacy: No long-term data retention

## Key Technical Insights

**Prompt Engineering Learnings:**
- Specificity in instructions produces better agent outputs
- Output formatting requirements ensure consistent parsing
- Iterative refinement improves quality
- Context preservation maintains agent role clarity

**Integration Patterns:**
- Webhook design requires clean JSON payloads
- Sequential processing enables logical agent orchestration
- Text processing needs robust regex patterns
- Error handling must account for agent output variations
