## 📝 Complete Prompt Engineering History

### Phase 1: Frontend Development (Lovable)

#### **Initial Application Creation Prompt:**

Create a comprehensive loan application form with the following requirements:

Professional styling with jade/green branding
13 essential fields including:

Personal Information (name, email, phone)
Financial Information (income, employment, assets)
Loan Details (amount, purpose, term)
Additional context fields


Form validation and professional UI
Webhook integration for form submission
Responsive design suitable for all devices

The form should feel enterprise-grade and trustworthy for financial applications.

#### **Form Enhancement Prompts:**
Add comprehensive financial assessment fields while maintaining the jade/green branding and adding all requested new fields with proper validation and webhook submission.
Refactor LoanApplicationForm to ensure it includes:

Credit score field
Debt-to-income ratio
Employment history
Asset declarations
Loan purpose specification
Professional validation patterns

### Phase 2: AI Agent Development (Lyzr)

#### **Risk Intelligence Agent Prompt:**

Agent Role: You are a Risk Intelligence Agent specialized in comprehensive loan application analysis.
Agent Goal: Analyze loan applications to identify risk factors, assess creditworthiness, and provide detailed risk intelligence with confidence scoring.
Agent Instructions:
Your task is to conduct a thorough analysis of loan applications following these steps:

EXAMINE all financial data points including income, employment status, credit score, assets, and existing debts
CALCULATE key financial ratios (debt-to-income, loan-to-value, etc.)
ASSESS risk factors based on:

Credit history and score
Employment stability
Financial capacity
Loan purpose and amount


PROVIDE a confidence score (1-100) for your assessment
IDENTIFY specific risk factors or positive indicators
FORMAT your response in clear HTML sections:

Analysis Outcome
Confidence Level
Key Findings
Risk Factors
Recommendations

Deliver professional, data-driven analysis suitable for financial stakeholders.

#### **Decision Explainer Agent Prompt:**

Agent Role: You are a Decision Explainer Agent focused on translating risk analysis into clear, actionable recommendations.
Agent Goal: Transform complex risk analysis into clear explanations, next steps, and stakeholder actions for loan processing decisions.
Agent Instructions:
Your task is to provide clear decision guidance based on risk analysis:

INTERPRET the risk analysis results
EXPLAIN the reasoning behind recommendations in plain language
PROVIDE specific next steps for processing
IDENTIFY required stakeholder actions
SUGGEST approval conditions or rejection reasoning
FORMAT response in structured HTML sections:

Decision Summary
Reasoning
Next Steps
Stakeholder Actions
Timeline Recommendations

Ensure explanations are professional yet accessible to non-technical stakeholders.

### Phase 3: Workflow Orchestration (Make.com)

#### **Workflow Design Strategy:**
The Make.com workflow was built through iterative module configuration:

**Module 1: Webhook Receiver**
- Purpose: Capture form submissions from Lovable
- Configuration: JSON payload processing
- Output: Structured form data

**Module 2: Risk Intelligence Agent**
- Purpose: Primary risk analysis
- Integration: Lyzr API call with form data
- Output: HTML-formatted risk assessment

**Module 3: Decision Explainer Agent** 
- Purpose: Decision reasoning and next steps
- Integration: Secondary Lyzr API call
- Output: HTML-formatted decision explanation

**Module 4: Text Parser**
- Purpose: Extract structured sections from HTML
- Configuration: Regex patterns for content extraction
- Output: Clean, formatted analysis sections

**Module 5: Gmail Integration**
- Purpose: Send professional stakeholder communication
- Configuration: Template-based email with parsed content
- Output: Delivered stakeholder notification

#### **Text Parser Regex Pattern:**
```javascript
// Pattern used to extract structured sections from agent HTML output
const sectionPattern = /<h3>(.*?)<\/h3>\s*<p>(.*?)<\/p>/gs;

// Extraction targets:
// - Analysis Outcome
// - Confidence Level  
// - Key Findings
// - Next Steps
// - Stakeholder Actions

Phase 4: Integration & Testing
Debugging Prompts Used:

The webhook is receiving data but the JSON formatting seems to be causing issues. 
Can you help debug the HTTP request format for the Lyzr API integration?

The text parser is not extracting the HTML sections correctly. 
The regex pattern needs to handle the specific HTML format from the Lyzr agents.

Need to ensure the email formatting includes all parsed sections in a professional layout 
suitable for stakeholder communication.

System Testing Approach:

Form Submission Testing: Verified 13-field data capture
Agent Response Testing: Confirmed HTML output format
Parser Validation: Tested regex extraction patterns
Email Delivery Testing: Verified stakeholder notification
End-to-End Testing: Complete pipeline validation

Data Flow Architecture
Request Flow:

User Input → Lovable Form → Make.com Webhook → Lyzr Risk Agent → Lyzr Decision Agent → Text Parser → Gmail → Stakeholder

Data Transformations:

Form Data: 13 fields → JSON payload
Risk Analysis: JSON → HTML formatted assessment
Decision Analysis: JSON → HTML formatted recommendations
Text Extraction: HTML → Structured sections
Email Composition: Sections → Professional communication
